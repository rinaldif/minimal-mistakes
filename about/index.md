Statistician & Data lover. Enthusiast about innovation and new technologies. All for self improvement (thank you Coursera!). If you can, automate it! Lazy enough to learn programming. Arduino rookie. Avid reader.

In a nutshell
============

In 2013 I received my Master's degree in Statistics from the [University of Milan, Bicocca](http://www.unimib.it/go/102/Home/English). I have since moved to Sydney, Australia, where I had the opportunity to work in several exciting companies such as [Datalicious](https://www.datalicious.com/), [Data2Decisions](http://data2decisions.com/), [Wetpac Group](https://www.westpac.com.au/) and lately [Cadreon](http://cadreon.com.au/) across a variety of industries. 

My domains of expertise are Econometrics Modelling, Digital Attribution and Machine Learning. Big data environments such as the Hadoop ecosystem and Amazon Redshift are an essential part of my ETL workflow. My favorite modelling tools are `R` and `Python`; graphic libraries such as `ggplot2` and `bokeh` are great for lightweight data visualization, whereas for more complex dashboards I usually rely on `Shiny Apps` or data visualization software such as `Tableau` (especially when large volumes of data are involved).

Things that excite me
============

* Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence
* The [Art](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/posters) of Data Visualization
* Snowboarding
* Thai Food
* A good book!
