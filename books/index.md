I love books. Any type of book really, from deep russian novels to mind bending science fiction, from physics and anthropology to artificial intelligence.

This is a place where I list the best books that I come across.

* *Superintelligence* by Nick Bostrom
* *Guns, Germs and Steel* by Jared Diamond
* *The Elegant Universe* by Brian Greene
